      Broken Heart Horse Farm welcomes kids between the ages of 6 and 12 to
      participate in our summer horse camps. All experience levels are welcome. 
      Participants will be grouped by age and experience level to assure that
      each camper comes away with new skills and knowledge. &#x20;


      Camp participants will ride each day and try their hand at both English
      and Western riding disciplines.  Students will learn about barn chores,
      grooming, equine health and nutrition, equipment and tack, and more. 
      Lessons are geared to experience level and activities change weekly to
      keep things exciting!&#x20;
