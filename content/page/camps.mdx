      Broken Heart Horse Farm invites children between the ages of 6 and 12 to
      participate in our summer horse camps. We welcome riders of all experience
      levels, from beginner to advanced. Participants are grouped by age and
      experience level to assure that each camper comes away with new skills and
      knowledge.  Broken Heart Horse Camp is a place where all are welcome,
      confidence is gained and new friendships are built.


      Camp participants ride each day, trying their hand at both English and
      Western disciplines.  Students learn horse and rider safety, complete barn
      chores, groom and bathe their horses, learn about equine health and
      nutrition, identify and properly use equipment and tack, and much more.
      Throw in some arts and craft projects and water fun and you have the
      perfect week of summer camp! Our camp lessons and activities change weekly
      to keep things fresh and exciting!&#x20;
