          Camp participants ride each day, trying their hand at both English and
          Western disciplines. Students learn horse and rider safety, complete
          barn chores, groom and bathe their horses, learn about equine health
          and nutrition, identify and properly use equipment and tack, and much
          more. Throw in some arts and craft projects and water fun and you have
          the perfect week of summer camp! Our camp lessons and activities
          change weekly to keep things fresh and exciting!
