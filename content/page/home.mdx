      When it comes to enjoying the horses we love, the process of finding the
      perfect barn is daunting. It's more than just a building; it's the place
      where we spend our precious free time; it's the community we become
      involved in; it's the training and coaches that give us the confidence to
      reach our potential, and it's the people who care for our horses.


      That's why, at Broken Heart, we're growing a respectful, welcoming
      community of horse lovers and a barn with premium facilities, elite
      trainers, and individualized boarding services with generous turn-out. A
      place where horses can be horses, and riders can safely and consistently
      progress in equine sports.
