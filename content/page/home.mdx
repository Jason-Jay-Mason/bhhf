      where we spend our precious free time; it's the community we become
      involved in; it's the training and coaches that give us the confidence to
      reach our potential, and it's the people who care for our horses.

      community of horse lovers and a barn with premium facilities, elite
      trainers, and individualized boarding services with generous turn-out.  A
      place where horses can be horses, and riders can safely and consistenly
      progress in equine sports.

          Broken Heart Horse Farm is the long time dream of founder and head
          trainer, Erin Mullane. &#x20;


          Erin grew up successfully competing in the United States Equestrian
          Federation. In recent years her passion for Ranch Versatility has
          grown, competing and winning in the National Versatility Ranch Horse.
          While Erin cherishes her own wins, her greatest pride comes from the
          success of her riders. &#x20;


          Erin has a long history of training both horse and rider to
          successfully reach their goals and compete at all levels, including
          national.  Her comprehensive training approach, drawing knowledge from
          both English and Western disciplines, distinguishes her from other
          trainers. Erin works with each of her riders to set goals and
          preserver through challenges, focusing on rider equitation to elicit
          the best performance from their horse. Their ultimate success is her
          greatest reward.
